# Pydict_weather

Î‘ program that displays a brief description of a four-day weather forecast for a city. The user can choose to display the weather forecast from two countries, Greece and Great Britain.

The data are from skaikairos.gr and timeanddate.com

(I chose not to change my code when I added the second country, so I can remember how I originally wrote my first real program. So I use two different formats to display the weather 
data. There is no consistency but again, this is just for fun and learning purposes.)
